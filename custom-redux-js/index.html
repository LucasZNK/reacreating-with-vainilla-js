            The book, Convert Anything to Calories, concluded that, on average,
            a person with a 10.8 cm^3 index finger and 11.7 grams will need many
            clicks to keep the line. See require 16.7 micromoles of adenosine
            triphosphate (the molecule that transports energy between cells) to
            move one gram of the body for a second, and since there are 7.3
            calories in a mole (the measure of amount of a substance) of
            adenosine triphosphate, in theory, each mouse click should burn 1.42
            calories. Although the calculation assumes the movement of all the
            muscle, so the actual amount may vary a little.

            But it happens to be Saturday and you're hungry. you get a pizza
            (1,835kCal) with a coke (97kCal), you would make 1,360,563 clicks to
            burn the dinner. And how is Saturday will probably involve a few
            alcoholic drinks: in a Gin & Tonic (120kCal) there are 84,507
            clicks, and 131,690.14 for each beer you consume. In other words,
            with 427 clicks on average per day, the computer is not a good
            exercise.
